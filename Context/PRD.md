# 1. Purpose & Scope

**Purpose:** Define requirements and context for “Briefly,” a voice- and text-first reporting assistant that transforms unstructured employee updates into structured weekly reports and tasks.
**Scope:** MVP implementation focusing on core job-to-be-done: reduce reporting friction and enable seamless progress tracking for employees and managers.

* Reduce time employees spend writing weekly reports by 50%.
* Increase weekly status update submission rate to 90%.
* Provide managers with >75% satisfaction on clarity and completeness of updates.

**Key Metrics:**

* Avg. time from input to finalized report.
* % of tasks successfully synced to external tools.
* User engagement: number of updates per user per week.
* Manager dashboard adoption rate.
